📁 services
Folder that contains service files which encapsulate business logic.
Services are used and coordinated by controllers to perform specific "atomic" tasks and usually interact with 📁 models and in order to execute database queries.

difference between 📁 controllers and 📁 services:
- a controller should worry about the request itself: receive HTTP request, validate request data (check headers, path & query parameters), initial data validation, ...
- a controller then coordinates one or more services which handle the actual specific tasks (database query, ...) and then sends back a response
- a service really only performs business logic (interact with 📁 models and the database)
